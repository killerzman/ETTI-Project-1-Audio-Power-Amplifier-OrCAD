# OrCAD Audio Power Amplifier 

OrCAD project of an audio power amplifier implementation. This remained only at a concept stage and was never physically created.

This project was made in year 3 of my university studies at Politehnica University of Bucharest @ Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology

The implementation was a bit **rushed and unorganized** and some of the documentation is in **Romanian** so **browse at your own risk!**
